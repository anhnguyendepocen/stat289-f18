## Course Description

Data science is an interdisciplinary field concerned with drawing knowledge
from data and communicating those results to various audiences. Data
science needs to be learned *by doing* data science. There are
no short-cuts and the process cannot be learned by simply working our way
methodically through a textbook of disconnected topics.

Therefore, this course will be taught using a problem-based learning model. As
a class, we will be addressing an open ended research question and discussing
various methods that will assist our inquiry. Both individually and in small
groups, students will take responsibility for particular subtasks that drive
our research forward. At the end of the semester students will have acquired
a toolkit of methods, and the knowledge of how to use them in practice, to
address important social, cultural, and scientific questions with data-driven
techniques.

We will make heavy use of computing throughout the semester, but *no
prior programming experience is required*. Also note that this course has a
MATH designation because statistics is currently housed in the mathematics
department. The topics of this course, however, do not fall within the
traditional disciplinary boundaries of mathematics.

## Object of Study

This semester our specific object of study concerns moving images, with
a particular focus on television. This corresponds with a project I am
currently working called *Distant Viewing TV*:

> [https://www.distantviewing.org/](https://www.distantviewing.org/)

I chose this topic because (1) its currently on my mind, (2) it involves a mix
of text and image analysis, and (3) we recently won a grant that amongst other
things can be used to hire student researchers. So, if you find the topic
interesting there are possibilities for further work on it in the spring
semester and over the upcoming summer.

# Syllabus

Below I highlight some of the most important elements of the course syllabus.
The full syllabus, which you should consult on your own, is posted on the 
course website.

## Website

All of the materials and assignments for the course will be posted
on the class website:

> [https://statsmaths.github.io/stat209-f18](https://statsmaths.github.io/stat209-f18)

The website contains notes, assignment details, and
supplemental materials. At the end of the semester, this version of
the course will be archived and available for your reference.

## Labs

Most class meetings will have an assignment called a 'lab' associated with it.
These consist of a set of questions that must be answered with either small
snippets of code or short descriptive answers. Often we will start these during
class, though they may sometimes be just for your own practice. Your solutions
must be uploaded to your GitHub page prior to the start of the next class
meeting. Labs are graded on a Pass/Fail scale.

We will start with the first lab during the next class meeting.

## Exams

There will be three take-home midterm exams given throughout the semester.
These are open notes and resources, though you must complete them on your
own. The scheduled dates for the exams are (all dates are Thursdays):

- **2018-09-20**
- **2018-10-18**
- **2018-11-15**

The exam will be made available starting at the normal start of class on the
date above; you will have 5 days (starting at the normal class start time on
Thursday and continuing through start of class on the following Tuesday) to
complete it. The course has no final exam.

## Data Projects

The ultimate aim of the course is to teach you how to *apply* statistics
to real-world questions. To this end, you will complete three data-oriented
projects during the course of the semester. The first two (called 'midterm'
projects) will be shorter in length and consist in you collecting your own
data. Your final project will be longer and will involve producing a tutorial
to introduce a new concept in statistical modeling to your classmates.

## Final Grades

The final grade will be determined by weighting the labs and projects as
follows:

- **Labs and Participation**: 5%
- **Midterm Exams**: 45% (15% each)
- **Final Project**: 50%

To pass the course, you must also miss no more than four class meetings.
Attendance requires that you arrive on-time, complete any out of class
assignments for the day, and fully engage with the course material.
Failing to fulfil these attendance requirements may result in a failing
grade of 'V' or a reduction to your final course average at the instructor's
sole discretion.

## Course Policies

The following class policies address some of the most common
questions and concerns that students have. If anything is
unclear, please feel free to contact me for clarification at
any point in the semester.

- **Academic honesty:** Cheating and plagiarism are grave scholarly
offenses and potential grounds
for expulsion; they are also a major barrier to your intellectual development.
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the entirety of the
University of Richmondâ€™s Honor Code. If you are confused or unsure about
appropriate citation protocol or any other aspect of the Honor code,
please consult me before turning in an assignment.
- **Special approval:** If you have special approval forms for extra
time on exams or any other circumstances I should know about, please speak
with me as early as possible so that we can best accommodate your needs.
- **Late work:** You are expected to submit all work on-time. Late reports
will be accepted after the due date with a full letter grade deduction for each
24 hour period it is late (rounded up).
- **Attendance:** You are expected to both attend and participate in most
class meetings. If you must be absent due to illness or other pressing
need, please let me know by email as soon as possible. A habit of arriving
late, failing to participate, or failing to accomplish any out of class assignments
is considered equivalent to an absence.
- **Make-up work:** In instances where students have a valid excuse for
missing a quiz, please arrange to meet with me as soon as possible.
- **Class conduct:** During class I expect you to refrain from checking
email, being on phones, or working on assignments for other classes.
- **Computers:** I except you to bring a working laptop with Python 3 
installed. If this poses a challenge, please speak with me at the 
start of the semester or as new problems arise.
- **Office hours:** Rather than fixed weekly office hours, I will 
provide blocks of open times to meet with me particularly focused around
project due dates. If you find me in my office, poke your head in and I
am usually happy to meet on the spot. Otherwise, please email me to make an
appointment so that we can chat. Please note that appointments should
be booked at least 24 hours ahead of time.
- **Email:** I will also answer questions by email (it can, in fact,
be much faster than scheduling an appointment for small issues). During the
week, I aim to respond within 24 hours, with emails sent over the weekend
responded to by Monday morning. If your question involves code, please attach
your current lab or report as that will expedite my answering your question(s).

These address some of the most common questions and concerns that
students have. If anything is unclear, please feel free to contact
me for clarification at any point in the semester.


## For next time

Please bring a laptop with an updated version of your operating system to our
next class meeting. If this is not possible please stick around and speak with
me at the end of the class.

## Questions

As a last task for today, please complete the brief questionnaires I am handing
out.
