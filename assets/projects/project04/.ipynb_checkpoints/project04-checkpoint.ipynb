    "perform descreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update user interface**: The user interface is fairly basic at \n",
    "the moment. Add, with appropriate documentation, the following elements:\n",
    "    1. Allow users to select the number of top documents shown in the\n",
    "    topics page and the most similar documents shown on the documents \n",
    "    page.\n",
    "    2. Print out status messages for initalizing the WikiCorpus object\n",
    "    and the function `wiki_text_explorer`. If you are feeling ambitious,\n",
    "    use the logging module for this.\n",
    "    3. Modify `json_meta_template` to construct better default topic and\n",
    "    cluster names. Perhaps the top 3-5 terms in each, seperated by a hyphen?\n",
    "2. **Linguistic Information**: I have stored a list of other languages \n",
    "that pages have been translated into in the `WikiCorpus` metadata. Display\n",
    "a subset of these (say, a dozen or so popular languages) on the document\n",
    "page by showing a country flag when a page has been translated into a given\n",
    "language.\n",
    "3. **Network Analysis**: Compute a network structure using the internal links\n",
    "and display the eigenvalue centrality on the documents page. \n",
    "4. **Images**: Write a function that finds the first image found on a\n",
    "Wikipedia page and store the `src` attribute in the `WikiCorpus` metadata.\n",
    "Then, add a column to the document page that includes the image. \n",
    "5. **Integrate with spacy**: Load the *spacy* module and use its much\n",
    "more sophisticated tokenization algorithms to parse the texts. Save\n",
    "the lemmas, perform part of speech filtering (nouns and verbs, perhaps)\n",
    "and use these in the `WikiCorpus` class. Finally, use the spacy document\n",
    "similarity measurement to construct the similarity scores."
