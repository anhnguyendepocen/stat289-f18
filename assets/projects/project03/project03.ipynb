    "Here are the steps that you need to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a corpus of Wikipedia pages, preferable something that includes 200-1000\n",
    "pages. *You should have some research question behind your set, specifically you \n",
    "should have some interesting thoughts about what types of relationships of forms of\n",
    "representation will show up in the collection*.\n",
    "2. Create a Wikipedia Text Explorer page for the corpus. Play around with the number\n",
    "of topics and clusters until things look nice. Not every cluster nor topic will \n",
    "be understandable, but at least some should make sense to you. Hint: you may find\n",
    "that reducing the number of topics to 15 or 20 helps a lot.\n",
    "3. Name, as best as you can, the topics and clusters. Feel free to give multiple \n",
    "names such as \"oceans/writers\" when the topic or cluster seems to contain more than\n",
    "one set of things (this happens frequently). Don't worry about the tricky ones, these\n",
    "can be labeled \"other 1\", \"other 2\", ect.; pay more attention to the clusters that\n",
    "make sense.\n",
    "4. Recreate the Wikipedia Text Explorer page with all of the filled in topic and\n",
    "clusters.\n",
    "5. Finally, edit the 'index.html' page (Note: the code will not overwrite this file if\n",
    "it exists) to have your own title, image, and 2-3 short paragraphs of expository text\n",
    "about the corpus. Try to focus on a few interesting details rather than just summarizing\n",
    "the entire dataset. Also, try to make at least one link to a section tag in your HTML\n",
    "file (I can help with this if you need).\n",

    "Starter code is given below.\n",
    "\n",
